## What is MerchOn?
An ecommerce website for local companies to sell their merchandise, and for consumers to purchase products from their favorite local businesses.

## How does it work?
Merchants and shoppers can both sign-up to sell their products and shop around from our storefront. By entering any store you can see what each shop has to offer. You can also search by zipcode to find a store in your neighborhood. From the shop you can add any item to you shop and purchase items.
